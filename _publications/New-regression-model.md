This work introduces a novel nonparametric regression model for compositional data. The primary contributions of this work are threefold. First, the model effectively handles the presence of zeros within compositions, ensuring greater flexibility in real-world applications. Second, it accommodates both continuous and categorical covariates, integrating a product kernel framework to ensure smooth estimation across discrete regressors. Third, the model extends naturally to the spatial domain, providing a robust framework for analyzing spatially structured compositional data.
